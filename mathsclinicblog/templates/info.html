      <p>DSME was founded by Micheal Akinkuotu in 2020. Micheal who is a 
        graduate with a degree in Pure and Applied
      Mathematics from the University of Ibadan loves to impact knowledge to anyone who is ready to learn. 
      Micheal, who is sometimes referred to as cauchymike developed a passion towards data science in 2019 to solve problems in Agriculture, 
      Health, and Finance.
          Despite the fact that cauchymike is not a full-time web developer, he built this website from scratch with python programming language using the Flask web framework to achieve
          one of his goals, which is, to help young and old individuals who are interested in becoming
          scientists, particularly data scientists without much stress.
      </p>
       <p>Some of cauchymike's data science and programming projects can be found <a href="https://cauchymike.github.io/cauchy_mikes_portfolio/">here<a>. </p>

      <p>Enough has been said about cauchymike, what exactly is data science? According to Wikipedia, 
        "Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes,
         algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from many structural and unstructured data."
         I love to define data science as the use of data to solve problems. With that definition, we can argue that
         everyone is a data scientist.
      </p>
      <p>Let me give a very simple example to butress my definition, suppose you want to go to work tommorow, you must have enough data
        to make some decisions like, waking up by 5 A.M, getting to the bus stop before 7 A.M, eating or deciding not to eat, and so on. This decision making, based on some
      data you have due to experience or data from random calculative guess is the process of data science.
